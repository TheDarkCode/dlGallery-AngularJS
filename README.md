# dlGallery-AngularJS
Simple, barebones, gallery module made with AngularJS.

Edit style as necessary. Use <dl-gallery></dl-gallery> tags in your html when referncing it with any parameters you want to setup.

Meant as a starting point or placeholder to save time when switching to a more complex gallery to fit specific application needs.

Requires the following dependencies: ngAnimate, ui.bootstrap, angular-loading-bar, ngTouch, and bootstrapLightbox.
